There are two different ways to create a thread:
1. Creating a class that extends the java.lang.Thread Class
2. Creating a class that implements java.lang.Runnable interface

    A a = new A();//creating a thread object
    a.start();//starts the execution of the thread
    B b = new B();//create an object
    Thread t = new Thread(b);//create a Thread Class object
    t.start();//starts the execution of the thread
  }
}

/*
NOTE:
Whenever we call a.start() method, JVM searches for the start() method in A class, but the a.start() method is not available in the A class.
So JVM goes to parent class,i.e., Thread class and searches for the start() method there.
In the Thread class, start() method is available, hence JVM executes start() method.
