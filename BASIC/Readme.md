### Basic 
- In Java, all the executable statements are placed inside functions called as **methods**, that belong to the class definitions.

For example, in the helloworld.java program, there is only one static method named as main, which is the first method that gets executed in a Java program.
- Any set of statements in between "{" and "}" define a **block**.
- The name of a class, method or any variable in Java, is called as **identifier**, which can be any string of characters beginning with a letter (or with an _ or $) and consists of letters or numbers, except the reserved words.

Some of the reserved words in Java are: public, class, static, try, catch, finally abstract, synchronized, true, false, void etc. *These names cannot be used as class, method or variable names.*

### Comments
- Comments are not executed by the compiler. These are basically the statements used to explain or define the working of the code.
- Used to increase readability of the code for ourselves as well as fellow programmers.
- Single line comments: // comment
- Multiline comments: /* comment */

### Data Types
- Also called as Base Types or Primitive Types
